## Selection Sorting Algorithm in Swift

Project that takes a selection sorting algorithm I wrote in python and translating it into Swift

## Slider Assignment

• Created a single view Swift app that allows users to adjust the color of the background by editing the RGB values
• Enables the user to edit the values using the text box or the sliders 

## Background Color App

• Swift app that enables users to edit the RGB and shading values in a text box or sliders to save the color of the background in the Swatch screen
• Stores saved RGB and shading values onto another tabbed view page with each saved RGB and shading color values stored in an image
• Utilized long press on the swatches to bring up the menu to share or delete the current swatch
• Implemented names, icons, and splash screens into the design of the app
